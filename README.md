# 🏥 Emergency Room Performance Dashboard (Excel)

A complete end-to-end Emergency Room (ER) Performance Dashboard built using Excel, Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX. This project delivers actionable insights to improve hospital efficiency, patient experience, and operational decision-making.

## 🛑 Problem Statement

Hospitals often struggle to track ER performance due to **unstructured data**, **manual reporting**, and **lack of real-time visibility**.

The objective of this project is to build a dynamic, automated Excel dashboard that helps stakeholders monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **patient volume**, **wait time**, **satisfaction**, **timeliness**, and **referral patterns**—enabling faster, data-driven decisions.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Business Requirement Gathering
* Identified key KPIs and data points needed by hospital management.
* Understood operational challenges and reporting needs.

### 2. Understanding the Dataset
* Reviewed raw hospital ER data including: patient age, gender, wait time, satisfaction, admission status, referral departments, etc.

### 3. Data Import Using Power Query
* Pulled raw data into Excel using Power Query.
* Ensured auto-refresh capability for future data updates.

### 4. Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance
* Removed duplicates, fixed formatting issues, standardized data types.
* Ensured consistency before modeling.

### 5. Creating Calendar Table (Power Query)
* A fully dynamic date table was created to support time-intelligence.
    > `= List.Dates(#date(2023,01,01), 731, #duration(1,0,0,0))`

### 6. Data Modeling with Power Pivot
* Built relationships between fact table and calendar table.
* Optimized model for fast and accurate calculations.

### 7. DAX Calculations (Custom Columns)
* **Age Group Classification**
    > `=IF([Patient Age]>=70,"70-79", IF([Patient Age]>=60,"60-69", IF([Patient Age]>=45,"45-59", IF([Patient Age]>=30,"30-44", IF([Patient Age]>=15,"15-29", IF([Patient Age]>=5,"05-14","0-4"))))))`
* **Patient Timeliness Classification**
    > `=IF([Patient Waittime] < 30, "Within Time", "Delay")`

### 8. Dashboard Structure & Pivot Table Creation
* Built pivot tables for each KPI.
* Structured components for clarity and user-friendly navigation.

### 9. Chart Development & Formatting
* Created automated visuals including:
    * Admission Status (Admitted vs Not Admitted)
    * Age Distribution & Gender Breakdown
    * Timeliness % (patients seen within 30 minutes)
    * Department Referral Analysis
    * Sparkline trends for daily wait time, satisfaction, and patient volume

### 10. Final Dashboard Development
* Integrated KPIs, charts, and slicers.
* Applied clean formatting for a professional, hospital-ready view.
* Ensured everything updates automatically when source data changes.

## 🔑 Key Insights

* Identified **peak traffic days** where wait times increased significantly.
* Found that certain **age groups** had a higher rate of admission.
* **Timeliness metric** showed specific days where performance dropped below the 30-minute target.
* **Referral patterns** highlighted departments with maximum incoming cases.
